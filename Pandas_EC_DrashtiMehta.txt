- The submitted project contains two datasets: 
1. Covid 19 timeseries of cases as per the dates and each state
2. Employment in each sector in each state
 
- The main goal of the project is to see the different employees (employment) in all the sectors as the states are affected by covid

- We take February to October into consideration here as initial cases appeared in Feb and then started spreading in March. In mid July the lockdown was lifted 
which caused an increase in the cases which is why the later months are taken into consideration to see the decrease in cases compared to July later on.

- We find that Texas has the highest monthly average increase of cases followed by California (which has maximum number of increases 
when it comes to individual months).

- Several industries are taken into consideration such as manufacturing, transportation, finance and insurance, health care and social assistance 
and art, entertainment and recreation. Out of these industries, we find that the art industry shows least employment and the health care industry has 
peaked in providing employment with maximum number of employees (relatively). The manufacturing industry follows it whereas the transportation 
and finance industry as more or less similar in terms of number of employees.

- Similar trend is seen in both the states regarding the employment in all the industries.
